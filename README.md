Virtual Assistant in Python

About
This is Bumblebee version 1. She is a virtual assistant made with Python. Bumblebee was made with the intention of automating certain boring or otherwise tedious tasks that I perform on a daily basis.
Bumblebee was also made with the goal of being easily extendible. (This is very much a work in progress as there are many more features I would like to implement with time.
So far, this version of Bumblebee has proven to work well with Python3.8 on MacOS Big Sur. (There was a problem with running on Python3.9 which I will look into soon)

5) Do math using Wolframalpha
6) Can send emails to any contact specified in a contacts.json file
7) Can clock me in and out of work (tracking how many hours I work my various work-study jobs)
8) Research mode *

Starred Features
1) Research mode: Research mode is a feature that I find super useful with my regular work flow. It is basically a mode that Bumblebee goes into where she tracks all the tabs I open in a google chrome 
browser and stores how long I spend on each tab. The information is then stored in a file whose name Bumblebee requests before staring research mode. The information is stored in a format that is easily
readable. This feature makes conducting research easier since I will not have to worry about bookmarking certain pages or having to go through my whole history in order to find a site I visited weeks ago.
Research mode can be turned on/off on demand and so it doesn't store all the sites I visit all of the time.
(More information about how research mode works will be provided soon)
